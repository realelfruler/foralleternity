There is the Outer Lands in the top left corner, with Sunlight Village labelled on the edge of the Dappled Forest (Capitol: Caisbaile), off the coast of which is an island labeled Famhair. Next to the Dappled Forest is the large kingdom of Naranthia (Capitol: Kolona). South of Naranthia is a large peninsula called Coaste de Melgrano, and southeast of that is Ghaniun Bial'alwan. South of the Dappled Forest is the Verdonada Sea, which is between that and Finapor. At the bottom of the map is a small collection of islands called the Fulican Archipelago."></a></div>

                    <p class="long-paragraph">Colloquially called "the Outer Lands," the part of the continent north of the Seelie and Elven kingdoms is largely uninhabited. There are many villages scattered about the tundra and up into the mountains, mostly filled with humans and half-humans descended from those who were taken by the Seelie, or those who accidentally fell into Tir na nOg.</p>

                    <h2>Sunlight Village</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Just on the edge of the Dappled Forest border, <a href="other-kingdoms/sunlight-village.html">Sunlight Village</a> is a farming community primarily descended from Y Bobl a Daliwyd (or "Y Bobl"), the Tafod term used for humans trapped in Tir na nOg by the Seelie. While the village and surrounding areas are populated primarily by humans, there are some fae and demi-fae who live in the area, outside the borders of the Dappled Forest.</p>
