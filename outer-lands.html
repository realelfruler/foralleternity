There is the Outer Lands in the top left corner, with Sunlight Village labelled on the edge of the Dappled Forest (Capitol: Caisbaile). Next to the Dappled Forest is the large kingdom of Naranthia (Capitol: Kolona). South of Naranthia is a large peninsula called Coaste de Melgrano. South of the Dappled Forest is the Verdonada Sea, which is between that and Finapor. At the bottom of the map is a small collection of islands called the Fulican Archipelago."></a></div>

                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Colloquially called "the Outer Lands," the part of the continent north of the Seelie and Elven kingdoms is largely uninhabited. There are many villages scattered about the tundra and up into the mountains, mostly filled with humans and half-humans descended from those who were taken by the Seelie, or those who accidentally fell into Tir na nOg.</p>

                    <h2>Sunlight Village</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Just on the edge of the Dappled Forest border, Sunlight Village is a human settlement descended from Y Bobl a Daliwyd (or "Y Bobl"), the Tafod term used for humans trapped in Tir na nOg by the Seelie.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Due to their history with the Seelie, as well as continued <a href="dappled-forest.html#relationships">stealing of humans</a> from the forest between the village and the Dappled Forest kingdom, the humans living in Sunlight Village are highly suspicious not only of Seelie Fae, but also of humans who dabble in the practice of magick. Despite the suspicion of non-humans in the area, there are many fae and demi-fae who live in the area around the village.</p>
