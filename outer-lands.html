There is the Outer Lands in the top left corner, with Sunlight Village labelled on the edge of the Dappled Forest (Capitol: Caisbaile). Next to the Dappled Forest is the large kingdom of Naranthia (Capitol: Kolona). South of Naranthia is a large peninsula called Coaste de Melgrano. South of the Dappled Forest is the Verdonada Sea, which is between that and Finapor. At the bottom of the map is a small collection of islands called the Fulican Archipelago."></div>

There are many villages scattered about the tundra and up into the mountains, mostly filled with humans and half-humans descended from those who were taken by the Seelie, or those who accidentally fell into Tir na nOg.</p>
