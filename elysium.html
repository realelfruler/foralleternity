While it is surrounded by several smaller kingdoms, its government is the main ruling party in that system, with very few connected regions. The population is 100% <a href="species/unseelie.html">Unseelie fae</a>, who are uniquely suited for life underground.</p>

                    <h2>Religion</h2>
                    <p>Like in many Seelie countries, religion and the government are heavily intertwined. The official state religion of Elysium is Darui Saenggi (달의 생기), though there are many other religions practiced within the empire. The main temple in Nirvana, Choseungdal Temple, is headed by the eldest male member of the Myung family, who according to tradition are descended from the New Mother Moon, who is reborn on the first day of <a href="elysium/religion/calendar.html">every lunar month</a>.
