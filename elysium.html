                    <p class="long-paragraph">Elysium (엘리시움) is an empire located in a large cavern system under modern-day Naranthia and the Dappled Forest. While it is surrounded by several smaller kingdoms, its government is the main ruling party in that system, with very few connected regions. The population is 100% <a href="species/unseelie.html">Unseelie fae</a>, who are uniquely suited for life underground.</p>

                    <h2><a class="name" name="history">History</a></h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The empire of Elysium was founded by Moon Seong-jae (문성재; Hanja unknown) in the year 0. At the time, the country was quite small, only spanning the land between Byeoljari and Kabigat Caverns. According to historic accounts, Moon Seong-jae was the great-great-grandson of the leader of the early fae, who came to the Underdark to escape a horrific war. Until the establishment of Elysium, it is believed that the Unseelie lived in disjointed clans with no central governments.</p>
                    <h3>✧ Aliyatan War ✧</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In 4290, Emperor Seong-su (文 瑞數) declared war on the only remaining kingdom in the Underdark, Aliyata (அழியாத), to the northwest, as well as Puleundal (푸른달), which was already surrounded on all sides by Elysian territory. While they were able to quickly take many territories from the latter kingdom, there is currenly a stalemate on the Aliyatan-Elysian border.</p>

                    <p class="long-paragraph">Like in many Seelie countries, religion and the government are heavily intertwined. The official state religion of Elysium is Darui Saenggi (달의 생기), though there are many other religions practiced within the empire. The main temple in Nirvana, Choseungdal Temple, is headed by the eldest male member of the Myung family, who according to tradition are descended from the New Mother Moon, who is reborn on the first day of <a href="elysium/religion/calendar.html">every lunar month</a>.

                    <p class="long-paragraph">The government of Elysium is split into 6 Ministries (육조) and 3 Offices (삼사). All members of both parts of the government, as well the members of the Imperial Family, are all a part of a complicated ranking system, which affects the ways in which they talk about and interact with each other. The ranking system is split based on which position is being talked about—the men of the Imperial Family, the women of the Imperial Family, the royal court, and government officials each have their own internal ranking systems.</p>

                    <h3>✧ 6 Ministries ✧</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The 6 Ministries of Elysium are considered to be the executive branch of the government. Each ministry is headed by a a minister, or Panseo (판서), assisted by a Champan (참판)</p>
