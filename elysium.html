                    <p class="long-paragraph">Elysium (엘리시움) is an empire located in a large cavern system under modern-day Naranthia and the Dappled Forest. While it is surrounded by several smaller kingdoms, its government is the main ruling party in that system, with very few connected regions. The population is 100% <a href="species/unseelie.html">Unseelie fae</a>, who are uniquely suited for life underground.</p>

                    <h2><a class="name" name="history">History</a></h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The empire of Elysium was founded by Moon Seong-jae (문성재; Hanja unknown) in the year 0. At the time, the country was quite small, only spanning the land between Byeoljari and Kabigat Caverns. According to historic accounts, Moon Seong-jae was the great-great-grandson of the leader of the early fae, who came to the Underdark to escape a horrific war. Until the establishment of Elysium, it is believed that the Unseelie lived in disjointed clans with no central governments.</p>
                    <h3>✧ Aliyatan War ✧</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In 4290, Emperor Seong-su (文 瑞數) declared war on the only remaining kingdom in the Underdark, Aliyata (அழியாத), to the northwest, as well as Puleundal (푸른달), which was already surrounded on all sides by Elysian territory. While they were able to quickly take many territories from the latter kingdom, there is currenly a stalemate on the Aliyatan-Elysian border.</p>

                    <h2><a class="name" name="religion">Religion</a></h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Like in many Seelie countries, religion and the government are heavily intertwined. The official state religion of Elysium is Darui Saenggi (달의 생기), though there are many other religions practiced within the empire. The main temple in Nirvana, Choseungdal Temple, is headed by the eldest male member of the Myung family, who according to tradition are descended from the New Mother Moon, who is reborn on the first day of <a href="elysium/religion/calendar.html">every lunar month</a>.

                    <p class="long-paragraph">The government of Elysium is split into several groups, each with different roles and responsibilities. The three bodies of the central government are the State Council (의정부), the Six Ministries (육조), and the Three Offices (삼사). Besides these, there are several other offices: The Royal Secretariat (승정원), who serve as a liason between the emperor and the Six Ministries; The Capital Bureau (한성부), who concern themselves with affairs of the capitol, Byeoljair; The Royal Investigation Bureau (의금부), who enforce law amongst the Imperial Family and government officers, investigating and prosecuting treason; And the Office of Records (춘추관), who record and preserve meeting notes and other material related to the running of the government.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">All members of each branch of the government, as well the members of the Imperial Family, are all a part of a complicated ranking system, which affects the ways in which they talk about and interact with each other. The ranking system is split based on which position is being talked about—the men of the Imperial Family, the women of the Imperial Family, the royal court, and government officials each have their own internal ranking systems.</p>

                    <h3>✧ State Council ✧</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The State Council of Elysium is the highest section of the government, answering only to the Emperor. Their main roles concern deliberation over state issues, advising the ruler, and conveying decisions made by the ruler to the Six Ministries. the three main members are the state councilors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Chief State Councilor (영의정, 1st Senior): </b></li>
                        <li><b>Left State Councilor (좌의정, 1st Junior): </b></li>
                        <li><b>Right State Councilor (우의정, 1st Junior): </b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">After the three councilers are seven lower-ranking officials who assist them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Left Chanseong (좌찬성, 2nd Senior): </b></li>
                        <li><b>Right Chanseong (우찬성, 2nd Senior): </b></li>
                        <li><b>Left Chamchan (좌참찬, 2nd Junior): </b></li>
                        <li><b>Right Chamchan (우참찬, 2nd Junior): </b></li>
                        <li><b>Sains (사인, 4th Senior): </b></li> <!-- two of them -->
                        <li><b>Geomsang (검상, 5th Senior): </b></li> <!-- one -->
                        <li><b>Sarok (사록, 8th Senior: )</b></li> <!-- two of them -->
                    </ul>

                    <p class="long-paragraph">The Six Ministries of Elysium are considered to be the executive branch of the government. Each ministry is headed by a a minister, or Panseo (판서, 2nd Senior), assisted by a Champan (참판, 2nd Junior). The ministries, in order of seniority, are:</p>
