It has an almost entirely human population, which primarily speaks Tafod. Of the humans in the area, most can trace their ancestry back to Y Bobl a Daliwyd, humans taken from Earth and trapped in Tir na nOg by Seelie fae.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Due to their history with the Seelie, as well as continued <a href="../dappled-forest.html#relationships">stealing of humans</a> from the forest between the village and the Dappled Forest kingdom, the humans living in Sunlight Village are highly suspicious not only of Seelie Fae, but also of humans who dabble in the practice of magick. Despite the suspicion of non-humans in the area, there are many witches,  <a class="hidden" href="../dappled-forest/oisin-dune.html">fae</a>, and demi-fae who live in the area around the village.</p>
