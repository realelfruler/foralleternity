                    <p class="long-paragraph">The second child of Filibert Drucker and Brunihilde Druckeryn, Mildburg was born and raised in Feendorf.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">When the Hightowers moved to Feendorf, Mildburg quickly became friends with both <a href="erskine-hightower.html">Erskine</a> and <a href="lachlan-hightower.html">Lachlan</a>, though she was much closer to the elder of the two brothers, due to the fact that they worked together in the Druckers' print shop. After the incident in 2019 which caused Lachlan to lose his arm, she, along with her father and mother, offered to take him in and care for him as he recovered. Shortly after he moved back in with his brother, Lachlan began courting Mildburg, with the permission of her parents.</p> -->
