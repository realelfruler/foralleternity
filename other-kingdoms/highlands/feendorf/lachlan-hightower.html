                    <p class="long-paragraph">Third of four siblings, Lachlan Hightower was born and raised in the Dappled Forest. He has two older brothers—<a href="erskine-hightower.html">Erskine</a> and their <a class="hidden" href="../../../dappled-forest/aonghus-campbell.html">eldest brother</a>—as well as a <a class="hidden" href="../../../dappled-forest/forbflaith-campbell.html">younger sister</a>. Lachlan's father passed away when he was 15, with Erskine leaving their home shortly afterwards. At the time, he was attending An T-Acadamh Leighis Ríoga (Royal Medical Academy). He graduated several years early with a Doctorate, at which point he moved to Klippeblau, where Erskine was apprenticed to a printer.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">After living another year in Klippeblau, Erskine and Lachlan moved to Feendorf, after Lachlan was told by a classmate that <a href="lothar-haas.html">a fellow graduate</a> had moved there. Lachlan became an apprentice to the doctor, Lothar Haas, while Erskine began working for the local printer, Filibert Drucker.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Shortly after Samhain of 2019, there was an incident in Feendorf which resulted in Lachlan being sent to Nördenlichberg. He lost his left arm because of this, and spent several months being cared for by Filibert's daughter, <a href="mildburg-druckeryn.html">Mildburg Druckeryn</a>. Shortly after he moved out of the Druckers', he and Mildburg began courting.</p>
