                    <p class="long-paragraph">Felix Blum is the fourth of nine children, the son of master artist Daniel Blum and his wife. He was born and raised in Nördenlichberg, originally going to school to be a doctor. He attended the Academy of Finapor, where he obtained both a Bachelor's and a Master's. However, just a year into his Doctorate, he suddenly returned home, dropping out of classes. After some time living with his parents, in 1991 he left home for his Wanderjahre, with the intention of becoming a master artist.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In 1994, near the end of his Wanderjahre, Felix lived for several months in Feendorf, as a tenant first with the monastery at Marmor Abbey, then with a farming family just outside the village. During this time, he created a large mural inside the church of the abbey.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">After the end of his Wanderjahre, Felix returned home to Nördenlichberg, where he married the daughter of a local merchant, Astrid Breineryn (b. 1970). The two moved into a small house with an attached studio, where Felix dealt with his patrons. Astrid and Felix had a child with a year of their wedding, a son named Baptist (b. 1996). The next year, they had a daughter, Cäcilie (b. 1997), then a second daughter, Diana (b. 1998). Their youngest child, Engel (b. 1998), was born only 12 months after her elder sister.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Just before he was to be enrolled at the local primary school, Baptist came down with a mysterious illness. He died in 2000, at the age of four. It was shortly after this that Felix left Das Hochland, traveling between La Costa, Naranthia, and Finapor. After two years of this, he returned to Feendorf for the funeral of Audgar Baumann, who had been close friends with when he lived there previously.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Shortly after the funeral, a fire broke out in the Marmor Abbey. Three people died, and two more, including Felix, went missing. This resulted in the annullment of his marriage with Astrid, who quickly remarried after he was declared dead <em>in Abwesenheit</em>. He was presumed dead for almost 20 years, when he suddenly reappeared in Feendorf. He did not return home, and still lives in Feendorf with the local doctor, <a href="lothar-haas.html">Lothar Haas</a>.</p>
