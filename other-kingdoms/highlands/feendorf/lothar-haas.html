                    <p class="long-paragraph">Lothar Haas was originally born in Klippebau to Doktor Deorwine Haas and his wife Deirbhile Haasyn. When he was 14, he was enrolled in An T-Acadamh Leighis RÃ­oga (Royal Medical Academy) in Cathair Verdi, Uamh, Dappled Forest. At this time, he lived with his mother's brother, <a href="../../../dappled-forest.html#military">Royal Guard Captain</a> Eoin Mac an Bhaird.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">He graduated with honors from An T-Acadamh in 1988, when he was 22 years old. He moved back to Klippebeau, working at his father's surgery for two years, before moving to Feendorf, where he started his own practice. He had heard about the opportunity from a friend, Dieterich Siegel, who already lived there. However, he quickly found himself dissatisfied with his life there, though he continued to live there.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">There have been several rumors in Feendorf and the villages nearby that Lothar is in a romantic relationship with artist <a href="felix-blum.html">Felix Blum</a>, starting some time in 2017, before the village learned that he had not died in the fire at Marmor Abbey. These rumors concerning the nature of their relationship are unsubstantiated.</p>
