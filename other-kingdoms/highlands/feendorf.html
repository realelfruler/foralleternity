                    <p class="long-paragraph">A tiny village deep in the Glockenblume Mountains, a couple hundred kilometers north of Klippeblau, the capitol of Das Hochland. It is primarily a farming community, but is also home to Marmor Abbey, a Blutend Herz Doppel-Haus. The village is also well-known for their accomplished Artist's Guild.</p>

                    <h2>Marmor Abbey</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Established in 615, Marmor Abbey was originally a convent dedicated to Das Haupt-Dame Saskia, a revered saint associated with love and fertility. A church and monastery dedicated to both Das Haupt-Dame Saskia and Das Haupt-Herr Odovocar was established in 681. Both the convent and the monastery follow Die Ordnung auf Dunkelvolk, founded circa 529 by Berahthram von Jubeljahre.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In 2002, a fire was started in Marmor Abbey by two unknown vandals. The fire claimed the lives of the abbot, Calogero von Ciliega, a farmer named Georg Brandt, and stonemason Simon Brodbeck. Two others—Felix Blum and his apprentice Cipriano Agnelli—disappeared during the fire, and have been declared legally dead. The fire damaged much of the monastery, sparing only the abbot's house and the dormitories. The monks who lived there were relocated for several years during reconstruction and renovation, and they returned in 2008.</p>

                    <h3>The Convent</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Die Äbtissin: Bernadette von Festung</p>

                    <h3>The Monastery</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Der Abt: Ludger von Biskopf</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Home to a small group of Dunkelvolken monks, the monastery at Marmor boasts a successful schreibenplaz, known for producing high quality copies of Das Buch, as well as Gebet-Buchen, records, and other documents. The monastery works closely with Die Gilde, and has in the past employed artists passing through Feendorf. In the church of the abbey, which is connected to the monastery is a mural titled "Saskia und Odovocar," a large landscape of the surrounding mountainside, featuring Das Haupt-Herr Odovocar and Das Haupt-Dame Saskia. The mural was completed in 1994 by Felix Blum, with repairs done by Brunhilde Druckeryn after the church was damaged in the fire.</p>

                    <h2>Gilde von Künstlerin</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Due to Marmor Abbey's reputation for creating beautiful copies of Das Buch, many artists are drawn to Feendorf during their Wanderjahren. One such artist is the late <a class="hidden" href="feendorf/felix-blum.html">Felix Blum</a>, an elf originally from Nördlichberg, north east of Feendorf. Die Gilde von Künstlerin (The Artist's Guild) was founded in 2006 by local printer Filibert Drucker, along with support from Blum's widow, Astrid Ebneryn. Artists currently employed by the guild include:</p>
