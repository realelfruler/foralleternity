                    <p class="long-paragraph">A tiny village deep in the Glockenblume Mountains, a couple hundred kilometers north of Klippeblau, the capitol of Das Hochland. It is primarily a farming community, but is also home to Marmor Abbey, a Blutend Herz Doppel-Haus. The village is also well-known for their accomplished Artist's Guild.</p>

                    <h2>Marmor Abbey</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Established in 515, Marmor Abbey was originally a convent dedicated to Das Haupt-Dame Saskia, a revered saint associated with love and fertility.</p>
                    <h3>The Monastery</h3>
                    <h3>The Convent</h3>

                    <h2>Gilde von Künstlerin</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Due to Marmor Abbey's reputation for creating beautiful copies of Das Buch, many artists are drawn to Feendorf during their Wanderjahren. One such artist is Felix Blum, an elf originally from Nördlichberg, north east of Feendorf.
