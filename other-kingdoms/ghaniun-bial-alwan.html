                    <h2><a class="name" name="history">History</a></h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Ghaniun Bial'alwan was originally inhabited by a small group of <a class="hidden" href="../species/sirens.html">sirens</a> who had come from the northeastern Fulican Archipelago. Starting in the 12th century, elves fleeing Ossocanti rule in La Costa de Melograno began to immigrate there. The sirens, who already had an established port and society on the land, welcomed the elves in, permitting them to establish their own subculture in the capitol of Alyaqut (الياقوت). When the First Elven War started in 1256, many fae and elves fleeing Naranthia and the Dappled Forest found themselves there. While the Naranthian elves quickly integrated into the Costan-Ghanian elven culture in Alyaqut and other municipalities on Ghaniun Bial'alwan, the Seelie fae of the Dappled Forest isolated themselves, believing the sirens and the elves of the island to be untrustworthy.</p>
                    <!-- something about the fae ending up integrating a little bit while still keeping distinct beliefs that influenced the culture already there? -->

                    <h3>Languages</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The official language of Ghaniun Bial'alwan is called Kalimat 'Ugni (كَلِمات أُغْنِية) and is spoken by approximately 86% of the population. Most people also speak at least some Common, which allows communication with foreign visitors. The third most common language is Melogranian, one of the two official languages spoken in La Costa de Melograno.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The Seelie Ghanian population primarily speaks a language called Gaghtnik (Գաղտնիք), also called Seelie Ghanian. It is spoken by 95% of the Seelie population, and about 7% of the total population of the island. It did not developed from Foraoisan, the official language of the Dappled Forest, leaving its origins unclear. However, it does seem to have been influenced by Kalimat 'Ugni, as well as some languages from the <a href="../outer-lands.html">Outer Lands</a>.</p>
                    
                    <!-- Culture -->
                    <h2><a class="name" name="Culture">Culture</a></h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Because of its siren majority population, the municipalities on Ghaniun Bial-alwan operate similarly to most siren communities throughout the world, with the strongest influence being from the Fulican Archipelago, just southwest of the island. However, there are noticable outside influences from the elven minority on the island. The most common religion practiced on the island is called Turab (تُراب). Followers believe in a central diety, called Al'Awhad (الأوحد; Common: The One), who has many <em>'awliya</em> (أولياء; Common: saints) who are prayed to for specific boons or assistance.</p>

                    <h3>Elven Minority</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Called Alhaduwn (الحادون; Common: The Pointed Ones) in Ghanian and Danakner (Դանակներ; Common: Knives) in the Seelie Ghanian dialect, [OTHER STUFF HERE]</p>

                    <h3>Seelie Minority</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Originally a small group of refugees from the Dappled Forest living in a rural area of Eamwd, the Almakhfiuwn (المخفيون; Common: The Hidden Ones), called the Achpararner (Աճպարարներ; Common: Magicians) were purposefully isolated from the rest of the island. The village that they founded, named Yerkink (Երկինք), was primarily a farming community. However, after many years of off-and-on drought between 1296 and 1302, they were forced to open up their community to trade with the municipality of Eamwd, several kilometers away. It was at this point that knowledge of the Seelie Ghanian culture began to be recorded.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The religion followed by the Achpararner is similar to <a href="../dappled-forest.html#religion">Ceathodann</a>. The Astvatsuhi (Աստվածուհի; Common: Goddess) is a woman with three faces, who can see the past, the present, and the future respectively. Holidays celebrating the beginning of each season, the harvest, and the full and new moons are extremely imporant to the social functioning of Achpararner communities.</p>

                    <!-- Society -->
                    <h2><a class="name" name="Society">Society</a></h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Due to its size, and the integration of non-siren groups, Ghaniun Bial'alwan has a structured government based off of governance structures imported by elves in the 12th century. The island is ruled by group of 5 viziers (Ghanian: وزير; Seelie Ghanian: վեզիր), who are all elected by the people of their sector. The five sectors of the island are named after the municpality there, but their borders often expand past that of the municpality into the surrounding forests.</p>
