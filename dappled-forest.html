                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3>🙚 Unitaithe 🙙</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The Dappled Forest was originally a part of the kingdom of Unitaithe, which stretched across the forest, north to the Outer Lands, across the Verdonada Sea to present-day Finapor. The capital, Chéaville, was situated on the coast of the forested area, which allowed easy passage between the two sections of the kingdom.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Unlike the present day, the Seelie fae at this time had a good relationship with the neighboring kingdom of Naranthia, established in 404. The borders were open and trade was easy between the two kingdoms. The royal family of Unitaithe, the Elderberries, were well-known for their relationship with many noble elven families, marrying their own children into the aristocracy of Seelie fae and elven kingdoms alike.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In 723, King Persimmon Elderberry, who ruled Unitaithe at that time, died with no possible heir. The two heads of his government, the librarian at the palace, Guiscard Champignelle, and the head of the military, Sir Cillian Dune, began to argue over who would assume the title of King of Unitaithe, eventually declaring war on each other. The Five Years War, as it was called later, resulted in the splitting of the country into two parts. Guiscard Chamipgnelle and his family took control of the island of Finapor, while Sir Cillian Dune and his family took control of the Dappled Forest.</p>
                    <h3>🙚 King Cillian 🙙</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In 727, King Cillian Dune formally established the kingdom of the Dappled Forest. He chose the village at the base of Cnoc Sliabh, the Holy Mountain of Ceathodann, the religion of the Seelie fae, to be the new capitol, which he named Caisbaile. He began building a castle at the base of the mountain, carving parts of it directly into the cliffsides. Though there was much outcry from many members of the local temple, including their Shagart, a woman named Siobhan, who found it sacreligious to damage the Holy Mountain in such a way. However, threats made by the militaristic government that King Cillian had begun to form quickly silenced the resistance, and Sliabh Rook was finished in 738.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">While considered a good ruler, King Cillian was well-known for his paranoia. Even before beginning to build his castle, he had ordered a wall be built along the border of his new kingdom, preventing any assailants from entering by land. He had an especially strong fear around invasion by Naranthian elves, and had extra security on the parts of the border shared with their county. This paranoia resulted in much misinformation being spread about the elves in the Dappled Forest, the effect of which can still be seen in the modern day.</p>

                    <!-- Religion -->
                    <h2>Religion - Ceathodann</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The official religion of the Dappled Forest, Ceathodann, has been practiced in the area for centuries. It centers around a deity called the <a href="dappled-forest/religion/goddess.html">Goddess of Four Faces</a>, or simply the Goddess, a woman who absorbed the soul of her three sisters after they died during a terribly cold Winter. The four sisters, or the Faces, are each said to represent one of the Seasons.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The Goddess also has a son, <a href="dappled-forest/religion/laoghaire.html">Laoghaire</a>, who is the shepherd of Mag Mell, what Ceathodannians call their afterlife. He became the shepherd after the death of his beloved friend, Corwin, who became gravely ill one Winter and died shortly afterwards. Distraught, Laoghaire slit his own wrists so that he could go to Mag Mell, and never have to spend time apart from Corwin again. His own mother, the Goddess, was destroyed by her son’s decision, and, using her spellbook, found a way for Laoghaire to travel between Mag Mell and Tír na nÒg, the land of the living, so that she would not lose her son, and he would not lose his friend.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Ceathodannians celebrate a full calendar of holidays. The 8 principal holidays are called the <a href="dappled-forest/religion/year-wheel.html">Wheel of the Year</a>, and mark specific dates indicating the passage of seasons, and the Seelie fae’s connection to nature. The Wheel of the Year is further split into the High Holidays, celebrated on the equinoxes and solstices, and said to be the time when the Goddess transitions from one Face to the next, and the Quarter Days, which celebrate specific events tied to the Season. Ceathodannians also celebrate the full moon with <a href="dappled-forest/religion/moon-festivals.html">Moon Festivals</a>, with specific rituals and offerings being left based on the time of year.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Ceathodannian temples are led by a Shagart, a person (usually female) who is trained in many of the magick arts, and is ordained to lead many different rituals pertaining to the different holidays, and to life in general.</p>

                    <h2>Society</h2>
                    <!-- Monarchy -->
                    <h3>🙚 Monarchy 🙙</h3>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The Dappled Forest is ruled by an absolute monarchy, where the ruler is decided based on bloodlines. In most cases, the eldest child is given the title of King or Queen upon the death of the current ruler, but there are examples of this not being the case, the most notable being:</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">Queen Aileen I (1238-1335)</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">During the First Elven War in 1256, increasing civil unrest became a threat to the Dappled Forest’s government. This unrest was furthered by the illness of King Conall, who most assumed would soon be traveling to Mag Mell for eternal rest. His son, Prince Alastair, was a fervent supporter of the war, and urged his father to abdicate so that he could take control of the military and defeat the elves. When King Conall died that year, it seemed that Prince Alastair would become king. However, his twin sister, Ailleen, convinced members of the court to have her crowned in her brother’s place, so that they might bring an end to the fighting. She succeeded, and was crowned the first Queen of the Dappled Forest in 1257.</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">King Eòghan (1655-1745)</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The third son of Queen Isobel II and Prince Consort Lachlan, it was assumed that, after his eldest brother, Prince Baird, became king, Prince Eòghan would assume the title of Duke of Tonn, the southern region of the Dappled Forest, along the coast. Prince Baird was considered to be a just and kindly person, and so, when Queen Isobel II declared that Prince Eòghan would become king in the event of her death, it took many by surprise. It was after this that it was revealed that, while Prince Baird put on a good show for the people, he was not actually a very kind, or even very intelligent, person. To prevent her kingdom from falling into ruin in the hands of Prince Baird or his brother, the publicly cruel Prince Hamish, Queen Isobel II made the decision to have the young Prince Eòghan, only 15 at the time, made the Crown Prince. When she died in 1701, Crown Prince Eòghan was made King, and he ruled until his death, when his only son, Prince Fionn, was crowned.</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">Queen Chrysanthemum (1980-)</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The second daughter of King Oisín and Queen Consort Virila, Princess Chrysanthemum was known for her lack of empathy for those around her. Like her elder sister, Princess Iris, it was well-known that she would not be made Crown Princess, with the title being destined to the youngest of King Oisín’s children, Prince Cedar. However, when Princess Chrysanthemum learned of this, she became enraged, thinking that the title of Queen was rightfully hers. Using her influence over the court, she manipulated those around her into overthrowing her father, deposing and banishing King Oisín and having Chrysanthemum made Queen in his place.</p>
                    
                    <!-- Social Structure -->
                    <h2>🙚 Social Structure 🙙</h2>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The Dappled Forest, while a monarchy, does have some social mobility, though not as much as contemporary kingdoms like Finapor and Naranthia. There are three distinct social ‘classes’ within the Dappled Forest, with subdivisions for different titles or roles within the community.</p>
