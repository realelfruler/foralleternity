                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px">A primarily Seelie fae country on the Southern Coast. It was originally a part of the kingdom of Unitaithe, which not only contained the modern-day Dappled Forest, but also the island of Finapor. After the death of King Persimmon Elderberry, the last heir of House Elderberry, in 723, the kingdom fell into chaos, split between alliance to House Champignelle and House Dune. After five years of war, the families came to an agreement, with House Champignelle taking control of Finapor, while House Dune took control of the Dappled Forest.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The first king of the Dappled Forest (est. 727) was named Cillian Dune (702-198). He was well-known for his extreme paranoia, with his first order as the new king being to build a wall all along the border between the Dappled Forest and the neighboring elven kingdom of Naranthia, as well as the Outer Lands, a mostly uninhabited plain stretching north towards the Rhume Mountains. King Cillian also created the first organized Seelie military, using uninhabited Unitaithian mansions outside the city of Caisbaile as the original barracks for the soldiers.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The official religon of the Dappled Forest is called Ceathodann, with worship centering around one diety, the <a href="dappled-forest/religion/goddess.html">Goddess of Four Faces</a>. Rituals and beliefs often center around nature, the passing of the seasons, and the relationship between life and death. Ceathodannian temples are present in every town and village in the Dappled Forest, ranging in size from small altars at the side of a road to large buildings with their entire purpose dedicated to worship. Much of life in the kingdom centers around religion, belief in the Goddess, and respect towards plant life.</p>
