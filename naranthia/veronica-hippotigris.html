                    <p class="long-paragraph">The daughter of Diodoris Hippotigris and Gaiana Raptis, Veronica was born and raised on a small farm in the southern region of Thalassia, a region in eastern Naranthia. Due to economic hardship in the area, her parents sturggled to provide for her, despite their success in growing and selling crops. Prices for basic necessities were often so high that her parents would not eat in favor of making sure Veronica got proper nutrition.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In the summer of 2003, Veronica was sent to Kolona, where she was to live with a friend of Gaiana's, a famous sewist named <a href="fadia-kaur.html">Fadia Kaur</a>. Veronica was told that this was so that she could attend a proper school. However, unbeknownst to her, it was to make sure that she would survive the coming winter. Barely able to feed themselves, Diodoris and Gaiana died of malnutrition some time near the end of November of that year.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">After moving in with Fadia, Veronica struggled to adjust to her new life. She was enrolled in the Crown Academy (አክሊል አከዴሚያ; Akeel Akedimeya), and started there only a month after her arrival. However, she quickly learned the Kolonian dialect, and excelled in her classes, especially music. In their free time, Veronica and Fadia would spend time at a restaurant called Nyla's, owned by Fadia's friend Nadia Rhonwen.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">When she was 9 years old, Veronica's musical skill caught the attention of Queen Eulalia, an accomplished violinist. She was invited to be a student of the queen's, which Fadia gladly accepted. Soon enough, she bacame one of Queen Eulalia's star pupils. She also did well in history and language arts, graduating with honors from the Royal Academy in 2016. At this point, she began to assist Fadia with her dressmaking business, taking a second job waiting tables at Nyla's part-time. She also had several pupils which Queen Eulalia had not had time to teach.</p>
