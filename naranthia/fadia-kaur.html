                    <p class="long-paragraph">Fadia Kaur was born Fadia ibnat Qadir Jawahir Thaqqaf to Qadir Thaqqaf and Bisan Iqbal, who had immigrated to La Costa di Melograno from the small nation of Ghaniun Bial'alwan (غَني بالألوان). She was the youngest of three children, with two older sisters named Atiya (b. 1974) and Jamillah (b. 1977). The family lived in a village in the southern part of La Costa called Olýva.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">While living in Olýva, Fadia attended the local school, helping her mother and father at their tailor shop in her free time. Noting her immense talent for embroidery, her parents saved enough money to send her to the Royal Fiber Arts Academy (የንጉሥ ክር ኪነት አከዴሚያ; NDKA) in the Naranthian capitol of Kolona. Despite not speaking common or any of the Naranthian languages, Fadia was excited and honored to attend the school, despite having to leave her family behind in La Costa.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">While attending the NDKA, Fadia became friends with a Thalassian classmate named Gaiana Raptis. The two bonded over similarities in the cultures of their homes, teaching each other recipes and sharing cultural practices with each other. When they graduated in 1997, Fadia stayed in Kolona, while Gaiana returned home. The two kept in touch, and Fadia moved in with Gaiana and her husband Diodoris for several months in 1998 and 1999 after the birth of their daughter, Fadia's goddaughter <a href="veronica-hippotigris.html">Veronica</a>.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">As a student at the NDKA, Fadia became the protégée of the royal family's personal seamstress, a woman named Callipso Diamantis. It was through this connection that Fadia became friends with <a href="eulalia-affean.html">Princess Eulalia Affean</a>, as well as the granddaughter of a local restaurant owner named Nyla Rhonwen. The three became very close, allowing Fadia to become the royal sewist once her mentor retired. Fadia also opened a tailor's on the main square in Kolona.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In the summer of 2003, Fadia was asked by Gaiana to adopt her daughter Veronica. The economic strife in Thalassia was too great, and Gaiana and Diodoris thought it best to send their daughter to the capitol, where she would have better opportunities. Though she wished to help her friend financially, Fadia's money was refused. That autumn, with Veronica already living with her, Fadia recieved news that Diodoris and Gaiana Hippotigris had both passed away due to chronic malnutrition. While she mourned the loss of her friends, Fadia put on a brave face for her new adoptive daughter, and made sure that she got the education and opportunities she deserved.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Fadia and Nyla ave always been considered close, with some rumors floating around that they are in a romantic relationship. There is no evidence of this, except for a tattoo on Fadia's shoulder of a woman called "Mammina".</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Because of her skill in designing and creating embroidered pieces, dresses and suit jackets made by Fadia Kaur are especially sought after for special events such as weddings and balls.</p>
