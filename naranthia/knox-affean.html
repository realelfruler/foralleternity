                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">The heir apparent of Naranthia, Knox Simion Affean was born in the midst of Letumia, an auspicious period of the year noting that great change is to come. Unlike his parents and many other noble children, he was doted on by his parents, and both he and Rowan (b. 1995) accompanied them on many of their outings since he could walk. As a result, he’s seen almost all of the kingdom and gained a strong interest in understanding the history of every region, down to even the smallest of oddities. Many of his lessons in the art of ruling—if you were to ask his mother— and the logistics of governing — referred to as such by his father— were done in a hands-on way with advisors and his parents rather than in his room and led by a tutor.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Knox, however, resents the role he knows he will be forced to take. The Aíma haunts his deity-given station, and despite the air of confidence and assuredness he puts on for society, he is riddled with endless doubts and anxiety. Like his mother, he took to exploring outside of the palace, though he often found himself over the wall that separates Naranthia from the edge of the Dappled Forest.</p>
