Despite being older, they are regarded as the spare though they have learned alongside their brother, Knox, for as long as they have known. Rowan is rather reserved, often remaining on the fringes of large events and observing others. They don’t take well to change, especially in their personal life. Like his brother, he prefers to be out of the castle when he can; he can typically be found in the palace gardens or the woods outside Kolona with a sketchbook in hand. He often walks with one of his mother’s older students, <a href="veronica-hippotigris.html">Veronica</a>, after her lessons.</p>
