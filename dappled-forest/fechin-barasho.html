Those who work with him say that he speaks with his <a class="hidden" href="chrysanthemum.html">mother</a>, and his <a class="hidden" href="rian-dune.html">father</a> died when he was 10, though many are reluctant to mention his parents by name. They say that his mother seems quite controlling, having kicked Fechin out at a young age. Not much else is known about him.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">He sometimes speaks of his familiar, a black panther named Alnamar, who his father gifted to him when he was young. She seems to be his only friend.</p>
