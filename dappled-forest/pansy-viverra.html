                <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">The daughter of <a href="oleander-viverra.html">Oleander</a> and <a href="bonnie-viverra.html">Bonnie</a> Viverra, Pansy was born with severe health conditions with an unknown cause. After her birth, several doctors lived in or near Chathrach Viverra, County Sg√≠reil to attend to her health. She was raised primarily by her father, due to the fact that her mother needed to visit home often, leaving her young daughter behind. However, Pansy was forced to live with Oleander's sister, <a href="melirianne-verdi.html">Lady Melirianne Verdi</a> and her family, due to a myriad of factors, including the disappearance of her mother in 2011, as well as her father needing to travel for botanical research. Melirianne forbid anyone in the family from informing Pansy of their relation to each other, posing instead as a kind benefactor who had willingly taken in the young girl.</p>
                <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">In 2017, just after her 13th birthday, Oleander was out of the country on a research trip. His request for entry back into the Dappled Forest was rejected by the Queen herself, causing the Verdis to become her sole caregivers. While she was given adequate medical care and schooling, Pansy was forbidden by Melirianne from attending social events, or even seeing her older sister <a href="salem-viverra.html">Salem</a>. Instead, Pansy spent most of her time either in her room, or in the drawing room of Chathrach Verdi, studying with her cousin <a href="nadia-verdi.html">Nadia</a>.</p>
