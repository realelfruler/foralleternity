                    <p class="long-paragraph">Held on the day of the <a href="../../../../calendar/summer.html#litha">Summer Solstice</a>, Litha marks the transition of the <a href="../../goddess.html">Goddess of Four Faces</a> from Alannah, the gentlest, to Niamh, the fiercest. During the day, Sun Rituals are performed, honoring the Sun and the fierceness of the Goddess Niamh. At night, it is common to hold bonfires and light fireworks.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Also common during Litha, and Summer in general, are handfasting ceremonies. These ceremonies represent the love that a couple has for one another, and are the most common way in traditional Seelie fae culture to get married. A part of the handfasting ceremony is "besom jumping," where the couple steps or jumps over a besom, a broom traditionally made from birch wood by the groom. This represents the threshold of the new home the couple will make together in their new life.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Litha altars are often filled with fresh produce and plants, such as tomatoes, melon, and nectarines, as well as sunflowers and dandelions. Also present on most altars are gold or yellow candles, solar wheels, acorns and oak branches, and God's Eyes adorned with bright colors.</p>
