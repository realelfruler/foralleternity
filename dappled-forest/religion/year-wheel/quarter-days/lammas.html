It's often celebrated not only with festivals and feasts, but also mock battles and various competitions, especially in smaller villages. One superstition associated with Lammas is that one should not harvest their grain before Lammas is celebrated for the year, as it's considered bad luck, and could bring rot to the rest of the crop.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">During Lammas, most altars will feature offerings of beer and fresh bread, along with corn, barely, and wheat. Candles on the altar are often orange or yellow, and other colors of the season. Dolls made of corn husks are also common on the Lammas altar.</p>
