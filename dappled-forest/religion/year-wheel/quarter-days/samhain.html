Samhain traditions focus around honoring and celebrating one's ancestors, and the practice of spirit work and divination among the Seelie fae. Feasts and food are commpnplace during Samhain, with food being made from the recent harvests. Depictions of and offerings to Laoghaire and Corwin are also common.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Altars during Samhain are the most extravagant of all those during the year, loaded with offerings not only to the Autumnal Goddess and her family, but also to ancestors and loved ones who have passed on. Mulled wine, dried leaves and flowers, dark breads such as pumpernickel or rye, and corn are the most notable offerings during this time of the year. Of the more macabre settings on the altar might be grave rubbings, real or fabricated skulls and bones, and depictions of ghosts. Candles might come in purple or black, or colors associated with the season, like red and orange.</p>
