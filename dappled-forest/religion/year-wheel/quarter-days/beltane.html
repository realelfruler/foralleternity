The Maypole dance, common in many religions in Tír na nÒg, is a highlight of Beltane celebrations. Along with this is the bonfire, usually held the night before, where people eat, drink, and dance in preparation for the holiday.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Commonplace on the Beltane altar are fresh-cut bouquets of local wildflowers, blue, yellow, and green candles, and acorns and other types of seeds. Rings, which symbolize the womb of the Goddess of Four Faces, and sticks, representing her husband Ofydd, are also present on most altars during this time of the year. Food offerings often include oats, milk, and honey, as well as the usual fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
