Each High Holiday celebrates the transition from one live to the next in the lifecycle of the Goddess.</p>
                    <p class="long paragraph">The four transitional holidays mark new beginnings, the beginnings of spring, the beginning of the harvest, the beginning of the year. While not as exalted as the High Holidays, they are marked often by large feasts and celebration, while the High Holidays are often more centered around worship at one's local temple.</p>
