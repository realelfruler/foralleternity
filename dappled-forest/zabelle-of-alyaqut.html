                    <p class="long-paragraph">Zabelle ó Broin was born on the island nation of <a href="../other-kingdoms/ghaniun-bil-alwan.html">Ghaniun Bil'alwan</a>, to Seelie parents of unknown heritage. She was surrendered anonymously to an orphanage in the capitol of Alyaqut when she was only a couple days old, and she lived there for the first year of her life. In the summer of 1998, just after the disappearance of <a href="oisin-dune.html">King Oisín</a>, the new Royal Druid, <a href="declan-o-broin.html">Declan ó Broin</a> requested a young child to adopt from the orphanage there, and Zabelle was sent by boat, accompanied by several members of the Dappled Forest Royal Guard, to her new family.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The only child of the Royal Druid, Zabelle lived a rather posh life, though extremely isolated. She had few friends, including the <a class="hidden" href="fechin-barasho.html">prince</a>, though she was not allowed to see them often. She learned several styles of magick, though, in keeping with the strict borders of the Dappled Forest, there was a focus primarily on styles from the Dappled Forest and Finapor. In 2010, Zabelle's father adopted a second child, a young boy named <a href="tadhg-o-broin.html">Tadhg</a>, who also became their father's apprentice.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The banishment of the Crown Prince in 2016 began to create a rift between Zabelle and the rest of her family. While Declan supported <a href="chrysanthemum.html">the Queen's</a> decision to banish the prince, Zabelle found her reasons odd and unfair. After several arguments with him about this, she left the country, deciding to travel and learn more about magick. In 2018, she decided to settle in Ghaniun Bil'alwan, with the purpose of searching for her birth family. It was at this point that she stopped using her father's last name and began to go by Zabelle of Alyaqut.</p>
