                    <p class="long-paragraph">The future duchess of <a href="../dappled-forest.html#regions">County Giuthas</a> was born in 1951, the only child of Duke Eachann Hywel and his wife, Deòiridh Hywel (née Ó Gamhna). She was raised like any noble child in the Dappled Forest, beginning private tutoring at her family's home, Teach Mór na Hywel, in Bialobrach, before moving to Caisbaile to begin classes at the Royal Seelie Young Woman's Academy when she was only 15. While living with the royal family, she was introduced to two young women, <a href="octavie-barasho.html">Octavie</a> (b. 1952) and <a href="virila-dune.html">Virila</a> (b. 1956). Young Lady Hywel immediately appointed Octavie to be her lady-in-waiting, with Virila joining her sister once she turned 15.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">While Virila was eventually excused from being a lady-in-waiting, once she began to be courted by the Crown Prince, Boudicca and Octavie have always been inseperable. After the two finished secondary schooling at the Royal Seelie University, they moved back to Teach Mór na Hywel, where Boudicca began formal training inherit her father's title.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">In 1978, Lady Hywel was introduced to Lord Barclay Irving, the younger brother of Duke Farlan Irving of County Cridhe. Already considered a spinster at age 27, she quickly wed Lord Irving, who moved in with her at her family home. They only ever had one child, Lady Grace Hywel (b. 1983). Only a year later, Lord Irving divorced Boudicca, now Duchess Hywel. The split was apparently amicable, though Irving left the country shortly after the divorce was finalized.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Duchess Hywel has always been considered a fair and just ruler of Country Giuthas, softening some of the more restrictive laws and policies created by <a href="chrysanthemum.html">Queen Chrysanthemum</a>. Her only lady-in-waiting has never left her side, and even walked her daughter, Grace, down the aisle at her own wedding in 2003. Duchess Hywel has never remarried.</p>
