                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">While not much is known about Prince Rian's life before moving to the Dappled Forest, is is known that he was born in the Fulica Archipelago, south of Finapor. At age 16, he joined a fishing boat passing through his village, wanting to explore the world. The fishing boat was owned by a pair of fae men, one from the Dappled Forest, the other from Finapor, who worked for a Finaporean noble family. They sold mainly to coastal villages and cities in Finapor, as well as some northern Fulican islands, and parts of coastal Naranthia.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">When the Dappled Forest's borders began to open up in 1990, Rian decided to settle in the coastal town of Portániasc. It was there in 1994 he met then-Princess Chrysanthemum, who had come to the village with her sister, Iris, for the summer. The two quickly bonded over their love of art and fashion, and Rian was invited to live in Sliabh Rook. The two married in September of 1997.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">After Chrysanthemum was crowned as the Queen of the Dappled Forest, Rian joined the kingdom’s army as a lieutenant. He was a somewhat attentive father of his son, and seemed much more fond of his wife's ward, Calliope Fogg (b. 1995) than Queen Chrysanthemum.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">In 2008, while on boat patrol in the Verdonada Sea, a strong storm hit Rian's ship, knocking them off course. Lost in the dark, the ship crashed on some rocks near Finapor, and the entire crew was lost. A statue of Prince Consort Rian was erected in the statue garden at Sliabh Rook, as well as a second statue in the Caisbaile Historic Cemetery.</p>
