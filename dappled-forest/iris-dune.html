                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">The eldest daughter of Oisín and Virila Dune, Iris was born to much fanfare. She grew up in Spring House, spending holidays on the beaches in the Southern Dappled Forest.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">As Iris grew, her manipulative tendencies began to worry her parents, as it seemed that she would do anything she could to get her way. She would bribe or even blackmail servants for extra dessert, and would trick her parents and grandparents into giving her extra gifts after being refused. She seemed intent on becoming Queen, with former nannies stating that she would act out horrific scenes involving the orchestration of her parents’ deaths so she could get the crown.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">On her tenth birthday, while out horseback riding with her mother and younger sister, Chrysanthemum (b. 1980), an incident occurred which resulted in Queen Virila being bucked off her horse and landing on the ground, breaking her spine and causing permanent disability. The circumstances of the incident are unclear, but many believe that Iris, possibly with the help of her 8-year-old sister, was responsible.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">While attending her first debut ball at age 16, Iris was introduced to Sir Florent Champignelle (b. 1977), the son of Lord Champignelle, whose family had formerly ruled the island of Finapor. The two became fast friends, and eventually began courting in May 1995, getting married less than a year later. The marriage was said to be a good one, with Iris apparently acting the “most calm anyone had ever seen her.” However, in 2001, Florent Champignelle suddenly disappeared while traveling by boat to visit his family in Château, Finapor. The reasons behind his disappearance are unknown, but many believe Iris to once again be the cause of the incident. Those around her, though dispute this, stating that Iris truly loved Florent, and still grieves him to this day.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Iris did not remarry until 2002, after meeting a man named Silver Windigast (b. 1982), a young musician from the eastern region of the Dappled Forest. The two only courted for three months before their wedding, and their marriage lasted only a year, after which Silver divorced Iris, leaving the country to move to the Fulica Archipelago.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Of the many romantic relationships that Iris had, none lasted longer than her marriage to Florent Champignelle. Her entire of list of husbands is as follows:</p>
