She married Lord Oleander Viverra in 2002, after a short courtship, and their daughter together, Pansy, was born just over a year later. Starting in 2010, she began to take long absences from public life, traveling to visit family, according to Lord Viverra. She was last seen in the Dappled Forest in 2011. She is likely still at home with her family, though it is unclear exactly where that is.</p>
