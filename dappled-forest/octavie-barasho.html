                    <p class="long-paragraph">The sister of the Queen Mother, and the only lady-in-waiting to Duchess Hywel of County Giuthas, Octavie Barasho is the eldest child of Elie-Yves and Hallie Barasho. Elie-Yves was from the North of Finapor, while Hallie grew up on a farm called Spás Glas, near Mionbeag, County Giuthas. Her family moved several times between Finapor, where she was born, and the Dappled Forest, where her two siblings, <a href="virila-dune.html">Virila</a> (b. 1956) and Daryn (b. 1958), were born. They eventually settled in Caisbaile in 1960, when Octavie was 8 years old.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">After Elie-Yves was drafted into the Noble War in 1965, Hallie got a job working as a maid in Sliabh Rook. To help support the family, 13-year-old Octavie and 9-year-old would sell homegrown vegetables. The next year, Octavie caught the eye of a 15-year-old noblewoman named Boudicca Hywel, who made her her lady-in-waiting. When her sister Virila turned 15 in 1971, she was made Boudicca Hywel's second lady-in-waiting.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">After recieving an honorable discharge at the end of the Noble War, Eli-Yves, now with damaged wings and a missing arm, rejoined his family in Caisbaile, before moving with Hallie and 13-year-old Daryn to Spás Glas to tend to Hallie's aging parents. Both Octavie and Virilia stayed with Boudicca Hywel in Caisbaile, sending money home and visiting approximately once a month. After she and Boudicca Hywel finished at the Royal Seelie University in 1973, Octavie moved into Teach Mór na Hywell in Bialobrach, County Guithas. Her sister, stayed behind in Caisbaile, having at that point started a courtship with then Crown Prince Oisín.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Having always been very close with her younger sister, Octavie attended to her sister shortly before and for three months after the births of her nieces, Princess Iris (b. 1978) and Princess Chrysanthemum (b. 1980), and her nephew, Prince Cedar (b. 1984). When Boudicca Hywell became pregnant after marrying Lord Barclay Irving of Cridhe, she was attended to by both Octavie and Virila. She gave birth to a girl, Grace Hywell (b. 1983), who was doted on heavily by Octavie. After Lord Barclay divorced Boudicca Hywell, now Duchess of Guithas, Octavie became a surrogate parent to Lady Grace, with many members of the Royal Court jokingly calling her Duke Hywell. This was not helped when Lady Grace married in 2003, and was walked down the aisle by Octavie.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">There are rumors of a romantic relationship between Octavie Barasho and Duchess Boudicca Hywell, but there has never been confirmation of this. When asked, Octavie responds that she is, and will always will be, Boudicca Hywell's dutiful servant.</p>
