                    <p class="long-paragraph">Formerly a Unitathian knight family, the Dunes became the royal family of the Dappled Forest after the Five-Years War, starting with King Cillian Dune (702-798). It is unknown exactly what mental illness he had, if any, but King Cillian's well documented paranoia around the prospect of rebellion or attack led to strict border policy and internatonal affairs which linger to this day.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">King Cillian had five children with his wife, Queen Isobel, Aisling (722-802), Lachlan (723-805), Eysteinn (725-789), Lorna (727-743), and Eoghan (728-821). Their eldest son, Lachlan, was crowned after King Cillianâ€™s death, with his own son, King Kenneth I (748-828) being crowned king soon afterwards. This pattern continued for some time, where a man would be king for less than two decades before his death, until the first Elven War in 1256, when Ailleen Dune (1238-1335) stole the throne from the rightful heir, her twin brother Alastair (1238-1324), to prevent the war from continuing under his rule, after the death of their father, King Conall (1194-1256). After the coronation of Queen Ailleen I, female rulers in the Dappled Forest became more common, but their numbers did not exceed that of male rulers.</p>
