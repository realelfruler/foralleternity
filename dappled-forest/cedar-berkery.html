                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Cedar Dune was born at Spring House in the Southeastern Dappled Forest, the youngest of three children between Oisín and Virila Dune. He led a relatively happy childhood, but was consistently the target of violent attacks by his older sister, Chrysanthemum (b. 1980). At his 7th birthday party, she attempted to throw a large rock at him, leading to Cedar being sent to live at Sliabh Rook with his grandparents, King Kenneth and Queen Isolde. He lived there until he was 13, when he decided to move back in with his parents, who still lived at Spring House.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">As a child, Cedar was very close with both of his parents, even after having to be separated from them. He had a strenuous relationship with his elder sister, Iris (b. 1978), and after the incident at his 7th birthday, he took great lengths to avoid spending time with Chrysanthemum. He was also very close to his grandparents, due to having to live with them for multiple periods as a child and into adolescence, as a way of avoiding arguments or attacks from either of his sisters.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">After the death of his grandfather in 1992, Cedar began to drift away from his family, eventually leaving the Dappled Forest in 1994, after Chrysanthemum brought Rian to live at Sliabh Rook. He deeply disliked Rian, for his overbearing demeanor and tendency towards rudeness, especially to King Oisín and Queen Consort Virila. Cedar settled in Château, Finapor, where he met Raspberry Berkery, who had traveled there to buy books for the library she worked at. The two became good friends, getting closer after Cedar moved to Esperidoeidés, the village near the Berkery farm, in 1997. The two eventually began courting in 1999, and were married at a small ceremony in the orange orchards on 26 June 2002. Queen Mother Virila was in attendance, but neither of Cedar’s sisters were invited.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">After a honeymoon on the beaches of Southern Finapor, Cedar and Raspberry moved to Esperidoeidés, where they operated a small bookstore. Cedar ran much of the actual store, while Raspberry assisted her family with their farm and selling their produce in the town. The two waited to start having children, though, as Cedar continuously worried that their child would grow up to be like his sisters, neither of whom he talked to anymore. He does, however, still talk to his mother, Virila.</p>
                    <!-- For when the story gets up to November 2021: In mid-October, 2021, the Berkerys announced they were with child. Neither Cedar nor Rasberry have disclosed what they wish to name the baby. -->
