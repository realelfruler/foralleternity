            <h3>Anatomy</h3>
            <p>Magick comes from a special organ, called a <em>lonnaigh</em> (Common:<em>invidia venustas</em>), attached to the middle thoracic spine, between the shoulder blades. It attaches to the wings, which allow magick to flow between the internal and external body. Seelie fae with docked or removed wings often have little to no external magick abilities. One’s wing type does impact magick abilities, though not by much. What types of magick one is good at are based more on social class and local culture. A fae who lives in a rural community or on a farm is more likely to have a wide range of magickal skills as compared to an upper-class noble, who will usually specialize in one or two types of magick relevant to their profession or interests.</p>
            <p>The cutting of wings is highly controversial in most Seelie fae communities, due to its disabling quality over magick use. While often perpetrated by governments as punishment for the most heinous of crimes, if it is done by private citizens, it can be punishable by life in prison, or worse. Wings which are cut without proper removal of the <em>invidia venustas</em> can result in Magick Sickness, called <em>Bladhaire</em> in the Dappled Forest, and <em>Flamme</em> in Finapor. Symptoms are similar to that of heat stroke, though in more extreme cases, they are also paired with the patient radiating heat, to the point that they are sometimes untouchable.</p>
            <p>While large ears have been documented amongst the fae, on average they are smaller and less triangular than <a href="elf.html">elf</a> ears. Larger ears are more common in those with congenital wing defects, but this is not a hard rule. Ear size and shape also seems to be correlated with the area in which an induvidual resides. Those living in the eastern parts of both Finapor and the Dappled Forest have been found to have larger, more triangular ears than fae in other parts of either country.</p>
            <p>The most notable of the Seelie fae’s abilities is their ability to speak to and understand plant life. This is facilitated through an organ in their brain attached to the auditory cortex, referred to as the <em>hortensis verbum</em>, which further processes and translates the communicative noises of plants.</p>

            <!-- Appearance -->
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>Skin colors are determined through melanins, the color of the connective tissues under the dermis, and the quantity of hemoglobin in circulating in the veins, and other determinative factors which are also seen in humans. As with humans, skin colors are highly variable, and are determined by UV exposure and genetics, among other things.</p>
            <p>Hair colors are much more variable in Seelie fae than in humans. Hair colors are determined through melanin, as well as hormones produced by the <em>invidia venustas</em> associated with the production of magick. Documented hair colors in Seelie fae fit basically through the entire spectrum of visible light. Most common hair colors outside of brown, black, and red include pink, purple, and green. As they age, Seelie faes’ hair often turns white or gray, based on their original hair color. Lighter hair colors are more likely to become white, while medium to dark hair colors become gray.</p>

            <h3>Ruling Structure</h3>
            <p>Within the Tir na nOg, there are two fae-ruled kingdoms, the <a href="../dappled-forest.html">Dappled Forest</a> and Finapor. While the cultures of these two countries are different, they are both monarchies, ruled by a king or queen who earns their title through familial descent.</p>

            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>Both Finapor and the Dappled Forest follow a religion known as <a href="../dappled-forest.html#religion">Ceathodann</a>. While there is variance in practices and beliefs both between the two countries and within them, the core belief is in the <a href="../fae-religion/goddess.html">Goddess of Four Faces</a>, an emphasis on a positive relationship with nature, and a belief in the importance of magick in daily life.</p>
            <p>Two weeks after a child is born, their wings are inspected by a Druid, and their magick levels are determined. Infants with four wings of appropriate size (Forewings should be ~1/4 their length, hindwings shdould be ~1/3) are considered the most desireable, especially in the stricter environment of the Dappled Forest. Infants with wings that are misshapen, too small, or missing are often seen as burdensome, due to their inability to properly perform magick.</p>

            <!-- Druids -->
            <h3><a class="name" name="druids">Druids</a></h3>
            <p>Druids are a special class within Seelie cultures, who are not subject to the social and cultural conventions that others must follow. Trained in a variety of magick arts, they are looked to as experts on all things concerning magick. Many rich families in both Finapor and the Dappled Forest will employ their own druid, especially if a member of their family has magick-related health issues, such as docked or damaged wings, or congenital defects.</p>
            <p>In the Dappled Forest, druids are trained in specialized schools in County Deas, County Craiobhe, and County Sgíreil. The Royal Druid, as well as the 10 County druids, are selected as apprentices from the pool of students in these schools.</p>
