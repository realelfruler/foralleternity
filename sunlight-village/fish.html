                    <p class="long-paragraph">Born in the small human community of Sunlight Village, just on the border between the Dappled Forest and the Outer Lands, Fish is the only son of <a href="siobhan-ifuru.html">Siobhan Ifuru</a>. His <a class="hidden" href="../dappled-forest/anton-cardiff.html">father</a> disappeared shortly before his birth, so Siobhan raised him alone, until she married William Ifuru in 2018, just after Fish's 15th birthday. Siobhan became pregnant shortly after the wedding, and soon gave birth to Fish's younger sister, Willow.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">After his mother's marriage to William Ifuru, Fish began spending less and less time at home, eventually leaving Sunlight Village to live in the forested areas nearby. Also during this time, he became friends with a witch, who helped him create a tattoo which allowed him to safely enter and exit the Dappled Forest without risk of being trapped by a fae.</p>
