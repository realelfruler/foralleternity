                 <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">After the death of older brother Seong-jin and niece Seong-min five years ago, Iseul was instated as Elysium’s Queen Regent upon her sister-in-law Seo-Yoon’s step back from the public eye. Once appointed, Iseul has taken it upon herself to involve Woo-yeong in her decisions and train him for the throne and try to teach him how to read auras in place of Seo-Yoon. A calm but slightly hesitant ruler, Iseul only wants the best for her family and her people but finds herself questioning if her decisions are what Seong-jin would have done himself-she worries about creating future problems for Woo-yeong once he takes her place and rules. Iseul has the ability to create light in her hands and has perfected it over decades, but most commonly uses the power to create dazzling light shows for the children within the palace.</p>
