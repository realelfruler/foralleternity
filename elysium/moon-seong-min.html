She attended the Daebyeol-wang Girls' School. There, she excelled in history, and public and international relations. During this time, she was introduced to a seamstress who was training to be one of her attendants, named <a href="hwanghon-soju.html">Hwanghon Soju</a> (燒酒 黃昏)</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Seong-min and Soju became close quickly, and the young seamstress was promoted to be the Crown Princess' sukyu, with Seong-min intending to promote Soju to be her sanggung when she became Queen. However, while returning from a family trip to the Anpu Lakes in the southern part of Elysium, the Moon's carriage crashed into another oncoming driver, killing Seong-jin and gravely injuring both Seong-min and her younger brother, <a href="moon-woo-yeong.html">Moon Woo-yeong</a> (文 宇靈). Though doctors tried very hard to save her, Seong-min died two days later. She was 24-years-old.</p>
