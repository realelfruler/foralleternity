                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Hwanghon Soju (燒酒 黃昏) was born on the first day of the last month in the year 4327. Their mother, a poor, unmarried woman living in the convents of Choseungdal Temple in Nirvana, did not want them, and immediately put them up for adoption, before resigning herself to the life of a nun there. Soju was raised in a children's home run by the temple in Byeoljari, where they spent most of their childhood.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">When they were almost a teenager, Soju was adopted into Byeol Miya, with the intent that they would be trained to be a <em>jangbong</em> for the <a href="moon-seo-yoon.html">Queen</a> and <a href="moon-seong-min">Crown Princess</a>. However, upon being introduced to the Crown Princess, Soju was given the title of <em>sukyu</em>, with the intention they would become her personal retainer upon her coronation. However, the death of the <a href="moon-seong-jin.html">King</a> and the Crown Princess destroyed that dream for Soju and her dear friend Seong-min (瑞潤).</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15">After the death of the Crown Princess, Soju was given the title of <em>jejo sanggung</em>, with their official role being to oversee the inner workings of the palace. However, after the Queen Dowager's exit from public life, their role has become more complex, assisting the new Queen Regent, <a href="moon-iseul.html">Moon Iseul</a> (文 이슬), in any and all situations.</p>
