She spends all her time at the temple, mourning her lost family. Despite the fact that the traditional mourning period of three years has long-since ended, Seo-Yoon still wears the same hanbok she wore to the funeral. Before the accident, she was very extroverted and talkative, like her son, but now she doesn’t say much at all. The three scars on her face are from the accident as well.</p>
