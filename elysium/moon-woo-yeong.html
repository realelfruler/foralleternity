His mother is the older sister of <a href="myung-ji-hyun.html">Myung Ji-hyun</a> (明 智賢), sei-kyōshi of the Choseungdal Temple in Byeoljari. Woo-yeong inherited the Myung family's aiblity to see <em>wolgwang</em>, similar to the Upper Lands' conception of auras.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">At age <!-- SOMETHING -->, Woo-yeong had the eldest daughter of the Namu family promised to him in marriage. At this point, Namu Ha-eun moved into Byeol Miya Palace, where the two were raised side-by-side together.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">In 2019, when Woo-yeong was 15, his family was driving back from their vacation home by the Anpu Lakes in the southern part of Elysium. Low visibility from a strong rainstorm eventually led to the carriage crashing into another carriage coming from the opposite direction, killing Seong-jin on impact. His older sister, <a href="moon-seong-min.html">Moon Seong-min</a> (文 瑞潤) died several days later, and Woo-yeong lost his left leg.</p>
