I need to add more later -->The overly sheltered only son of the former king, Moon Seong-jin, Woo-yeong doesn’t get to go much of anywhere. He lost his left leg in the accident that killed his father and elder sister, Moon Seong-min, and his untrained power to see wolgwang (Literally moonlight, Unseelie word for auras), a rare power inherited from his mother, doesn’t help much with his want for freedom. He has zero friends except for his betrothed, Namu Ha-Eun, but is otherwise a very extroverted and talkative teenager.</a>
