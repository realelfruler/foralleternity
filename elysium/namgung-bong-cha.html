                        <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Namgung Bong-cha (남궁 鋒次) is the younger daughter of Namgung Min-sik (남궁 旼汐) and Namgung Suk-ja (남궁 淑子). Her father, a distant relative of Kyungseong-daewang (景城 대왕), was very wealthy, and paid for Bong-cha to attend the prestigious Daebyeol-wang Girls' School, where she not only learned math, sciences, literature, and history, but also a unique type of martial arts created in Elysium.</p>
                        <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Through her education in martial arts, as well as learning the history of her country, Bong-cha followed her older sister Soon-bok (남궁 純福) into the imperial military, where the two work to map and explore the Underdark. Through this work, Bong-cha was able to go to the <a href="../dappled-forest.html">Upper Lands</a>, where she met Oleander Viverra, a scientist and recent widower. After a short courtship, the two were married, and moved to his home of Civetta, the seat of the duchy of Sgíreil. She easily took to being the step-mother of Oleander's daughter, Salem. During this time, she went by the name <a href="../dappled-forest/bonnie-viverra.html">Bonnie</a>, and told her parents and superiors in the military that she was living in another Underdark kingdom in an area under the kingdom of Finapor called Ànhào.</p>
                        <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin: 5px 0 15px">Because of Unseelie fae biology, Bong-cha quickly realized that she could not live for extended periods of tme in the Upper Lands. She often spent time in caverns dug out under Civetta for the express purpose of allowing Bong-cha to rest and recuperate after extended periods of time in the courts of the Dappled Forest. After the birth of her daughter, Pansy, she and the baby spent several days at a time in these caverns, which were later extended so that they connected with the Kabigat Cavern system in the Underdark.</p>
                        <p>In 2010, Suk-ja became very ill, requiring Bong-cha to travel back and forth between Civetta and her parents' home in Byeoljari. This, coupled with issues obtaining citizenship in the Dappled Forest, kept Bong-cha away from her family for weeks at a time. The next year, she left home for what she did not realize would be the last time for many years.</p>
                        <p>All but trapped in Elysium, Bong-cha continues to write letters to Oleander, who often travels for research and teaching opportunities, as well as Pansy, who is currently in the custody of Oleander's older sister, <a href="../dappled-forest/melirianne-verdi.html">Lady Melirianne Verdi</a>, and her husband, Lord Remis Verdi.</p>
