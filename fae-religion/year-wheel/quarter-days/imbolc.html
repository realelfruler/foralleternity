                    <p class="long-paragraph">Celebrated in February, <a href="../../../calendar/winter.html#imbolc">Imbolc</a> is a reminder of the coming spring. Fire festivals, cleansing ceremonies, and divination are all common during this season. Heightened magick flowing through Tír na nÒg during Imbolc allow more ritual practice than during other seasons. There is often a focus on love, family, and the home in many rituals during this time, including love spells, despite their illegality in many Seelie fae countries, including the Dappled Forest.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Altars during Imbolc often have blue and white candles, colors associated with the Winter Goddess, and cauldrons or depictions of cauldrons with fire in them. Food offerings usually include baked goods, especially those made with eggs or dairy, as well as warm drinks like cider and mead. Depictions of sacred animals, like sheep and deer, as well as healing herbs and poetry, are all common on altars during this time of the year.</p>
