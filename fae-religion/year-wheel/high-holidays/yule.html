                    <p class="long-paragraph">Yule, the first High Holiday of the year, is considered to be the birthday of the oldest of the faces of the <a href="../../goddess.html">Goddess</a>, Fionnuala, and is held during the <a href="../../../calendar/winter.html#yule">Winter Solstice</a>. It is a time for spending time with family, and for providing for others in the community. Celebrations and prayer are based around the actions of Fionnuala, absorbing the souls of her sisters into her own body to allow them to live on through her. Expectations of charity and caring are heightened during Yule-time. Temples often open their doors to the poor and working-class during this time to provide them with food and shelter from the bitter winters in the Dappled Forest.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">During Yule, altars are often filled with red candles, branches of different evergreen trees, mistletoe, and <em>besoms</em>, brooms made with blessed birch branches. Food includes desserts, such as shortbread and pound cake, oranges, and various types of nuts. Bells are often used in rituals during Yule-time, used to bring harmony, as well as to drive away evil spirits and the fabled <a href="../../elysium.html">Unseelie</a>.</p>
