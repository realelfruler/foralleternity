                    <p class="long-paragraph">The High Holiday of Ostara, held on the <a href="../../../calendar/spring.html#ostara">Spring Equinox</a>, marks the transition of the <a href="../../goddess.html">Goddess of Four Faces</a> from Fionnula, the oldest sister, to Alannah, the gentlest sister. It's also considered to be Alannah's birthday. The Seelie fae celebrate this holiday through meditation and rituals representing rebirth. One such ritual, called the Athbreith, involves a symbolic rebirth of the participant under the direction of the Shagart, the head of the temple. Afterwards, temple-goers often celebrate with a Cakes and Ale ceremony or other celebrations.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">Altars during Ostara are often filled with flowers, eggs, and other representations of spring and renewal. Many altars often include depictions of baby animals, especially rabbits, robins, and deer.</p>
