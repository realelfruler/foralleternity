                    <p class="long-paragraph">The final High Holiday of the year, Mabon represents the transition of the <a href="../../goddess.html">Goddess of Four Faces</a> to Eithne, the youngest. Celebrated on the <a href="../../../calendar/autumn.html#mabon">Autumn Equinox</a>, it is one of the many holidays where the Seelie fae contemplate and prepare for the coming Winter. Mabon celebrations include prayers and rituals centering around gratitude for the Goddess for their life and experiences, as well as protection rituals for the home and loved ones.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">During Mabon, altars are often filled with the last fruits of the harvest, including pumpkins, wheat, apples, and pomegranates. Seeds, nuts, and corn are also common. Candles placed on the altar for Mabon are usually orange or red, colors associated with autumn, and no altar on Mabon is complete without wine or beer, made from one's own crops if possible.
