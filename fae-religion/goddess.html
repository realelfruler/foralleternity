                    <p class="long-paragraph" style="margin-top: 25px">The Goddess of Four Faces is the main diety in most Seelie fae religions, especially that of Finapor and the Dappled Forest. She is considered the creator of the world, as well as the ruler of the Seasons, and the one who decides the fates of the living. In most scripture, the Goddess is accompanied by her son, Laoghaire, the shepherd of the dead, who tends to those living in Mag Mell, the name of the Seelie fae afterlife.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">According to <a href="four-sisters.html">tradition</a>, the Goddess of Four Faces originally was four separate women, sisters who lived on Cnoc Sliabh, where Sliabh Rook is located in the modern day. One winter, it became bitterly cold, and the four sister huddled in their cabin for warmth. They slowly began to freeze to death, and the eldest sister, Fionnuala, in an act of desparation, cast a spell which absorbed her sisters' souls, allowing all four to survive together in one body.</p>
                    <p class="long-paragraph">The Goddess' son Laoghaire was a demigod born to the Autumnal Goddess and a young shepherd living at the base of Cnoc Sliabh. He was born with the ability to see ghosts, and magick powerful enough to rival his mother's. Destroyed by grief at the death of his closest friend, a young man named Corwin, Laoghaire died by suicide so they would never be separated. The Goddess, distraught by the loss of her own son, then helped him create a way for him to travel between the two realms. This resulted in him beginning to collect lost souls stuck in the Magick Realm, helping them depart to Mag Mell to live out their eternity in peace.</p>
